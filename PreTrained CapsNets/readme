We provide a pretrained Capsule Network based on the dynamic routing mechanism, following the original implementation proposed by Sabour et al. (“Dynamic Routing Between Capsules”). 
The network is trained on the MNIST dataset and achieves stable classification performance while preserving the interpretable properties characteristic of capsule-based representations.
